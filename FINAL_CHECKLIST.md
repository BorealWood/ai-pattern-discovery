- **Updates:** Can submit revised versions anytime

### 5. After Submission
- Share arXiv link on social media, with colleagues
- Monitor for comments and feedback
- Prepare code/data repository for v2 update
- Consider journal submission (Physical Review X, Nature Physics)

## 🎯 Recommended Timeline

### Immediate (Today)
1. Review REWRITE_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (confirms all changes)
2. Review PAPER_STATUS.md (current quality assessment)
3. Read through main.tex one final time
4. Decide: Submit now or wait for code?

### Option A: Submit Today
- **Pros:** Establish priority, get early feedback
- **Cons:** No figures/code yet (but acceptable for preprint)
- **Action:** Create arXiv account, upload, submit
- **Timeline:** 24 hours to publication

### Option B: Complete Implementation (7-10 days)
- **Day 1-3:** Write 5 validation scripts
- **Day 4-5:** Generate 6 figures  
- **Day 6:** Test compilation with figures
- **Day 7:** Create GitHub repository
- **Day 8:** Update paper with figure references
- **Day 9:** Final review

- Export as PDF for LaTeX inclusion

### GitHub Repository
- Create repo: `universal-information-principle`
- Structure: code/, data/, figures/, paper/
- Add README.md with reproduction instructions

## 📊 Your Paper's Strengths

**What makes this publication-worthy:**
